                NYC TNG is a group established to promote and facilitate the gathering and interaction of people between the ages of 18 to 35 who are interested or think they might be interested in the BDSM or M/s lifestyle.<br/><br/>
NYC TNG encourages discussion and open communication.  For a forum and discussion topics, please visit our group on <a href='http://fetlife.com/groups/10776'>FetLife</a>.  We are listed as "NYC TNG 18 - 35" and can easily be found using the search function.  Additionally, if you have any questions for the organizers, you can get in touch with us directly <a href='/contact.php'>here</a>.<br/><br/>
We believe it is of extreme importance that people between the ages of 18 to 35 have an opportunity to gather in person and share ideas and concerns, or simply spend time together. To that end, NYC TNG, in addition to being an online community for discussion and provision of information, has set meeting times where members or people who might be interested can come and spend time with other young people with similar interests.
